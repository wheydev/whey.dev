# CLAUDE.md - WheyDev

## What is WheyDev

WheyDev is a one-person software studio that builds focused products for developers and creators. The brand is built around "building strong products for modern makers" — shipping real software in public at the intersection of AI, productivity, and software.

The name comes from whey protein: it gives you strength at the gym, WheyDev gives you strength as a builder. The word "strong" is intentional throughout the brand.

WheyDev LLC is a US entity. Products are priced in USD for the American market.

## Core philosophy

- Products, not experiments. Everything shipped is real and usable from day one.
- Built in public. Process, numbers, and learnings are shared openly.
- Simple, fast, and focused. No feature bloat, no over-engineering.
- "Strong" is a brand keyword tied to the name's origin. Use it intentionally.

## Tech stack

- Astro 5, React 18, TypeScript (strict mode)
- Panda CSS (type-safe, zero-runtime styling with design tokens)
- PostHog (client-side analytics with manual event tracking)
- Yarn Berry (v4)
- Deployed on Vercel

## Brand language

- "Products" not "labs", "experiments", or "tools"

- "Execution" not "experimentation" (as a value)
- "Strong" is a core brand word — use it naturally, not forced

## Coding conventions

- Astro components by default; React only for interactive islands (`client:*`)
- PostHog tracking uses `posthog.capture()` with descriptive event names
- Mobile-responsive design via Panda CSS responsive tokens/conditions
