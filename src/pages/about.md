<a href="https://ederspath.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eder Christian</a> is a technology professional with a Technical Computation course from ETEC Cachoeira Paulista - SP (Brazil), a degree in Information Technology Management from FATEC Guaratingueta - SP (Brazil), and a postgraduate degree in Web Applications Projects and Development from UNIFATEA in Lorena - SP (Brazil).

With a career marked by dedication and entrepreneurship, Eder played a crucial role at StartSe, an education startup, for nearly 6 years. Starting as a Junior Front-end Developer, he progressed to become a partner, contributing across various areas including sales, marketing, video editing, and design. His involvement in these different areas gave him a comprehensive view of how a startup operates.

Currently, Eder is excited to be part of <a href="https://automatiq.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automatiq</a>, the technology leader within ticket resale, providing resellers of all sizes pricing automation, automated distribution, data analytics, order processing, and consignment. In this new phase of his career, he is eager to apply his experience and knowledge acquired over the years to drive Automatiq’s success and contribute to the development of advanced technological solutions.

With his entrepreneurial background and experience in startups, Eder is enthusiastic about sharing his insights and helping WheyDev’s visitors build a solid foundation in programming — while documenting his own ongoing studies to learn in public — empowering them to achieve their goals and succeed in their own projects.

The WheyDev project is open to future partnerships and community building aimed at strengthening and empowering the surrounding environment.
