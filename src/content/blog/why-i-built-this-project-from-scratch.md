description: Join me on my journey of building WheyDev from scratch, sharing my experiences, challenges, and growth as a developer. Let's get stronger together, both technically and personally!
---

Given my background, I never imagined that in just five years, I’d be working at a startup, becoming a partner, attending over 70 tech events, working remotely for an American company, and even launching my own business.

I’m from a small town in Brazil, raised in a poor family and always attended public schools. Everyone in Brazil knows that education isn’t the country’s strong suit, but we also know it can be a game-changer. That’s exactly what happened to me.

I had no idea I could be part of global projects and impact millions with my work. Technology opened those doors for me.

Back in 2016, I came across a different take on entrepreneurship. When you think of it, you might picture starting a company or a business. But for me, it was more about “taking charge of my life.” That’s what I did.

In 2017, I left my little town and moved to São Paulo, the biggest city in Brazil, with a junior front-end developer job lined up, very little cash, and no clue where I’d sleep.

I was lucky to have some amazing people in my corner who helped me along the way and were crucial to my growth.

During that time, I went through a sedentary phase, but I knew I had to change. Right after the COVID-19 pandemic, I started seeing great doctors regularly, eating healthier, and exercising at least six days a week. Right now, I need to get back into a consistent workout routine.

I began supplementing with creatine and whey protein. With the right dosages and prescriptions from a good doctor, it can really help you get stronger.

Beyond physical strength, I also want to boost my skills in my profession. The idea behind WheyDev was to combine “whey”, which helps us become stronger, with “dev”, representing my profession.

I don’t have a degree in Computer Science; I studied Information Technology Management academically, along with countless hours of self-taught programming. My foundation isn’t entirely solid yet. My career has been built on needs, and I’ve learned as I’ve gone.

Here’s a quick timeline of my journey:

- Started out doing computer support.
- Worked at a small marketing agency where I learned to build websites with WordPress, edit videos, and design graphics in Photoshop and Illustrator.
- Decided to pursue a postgraduate degree focused on Web Application Projects and Development, which kicked off my career.
- Began creating basic landing pages using HTML, CSS, jQuery, and a bit of JavaScript.
- Started building projects with React.
- Developed some pet projects using Next.js.
- Needed to level up my backend skills and learned the basics of Elixir.

I like to be rational, but I also make room for intuition in both my personal and professional life. It’s time to solidify my foundations. WheyDev is about that: it’s a learn in public project where I’ll document my journey to becoming a stronger developer. It’s not just about the tech side; we need to go deeper.

Here, we’ll talk about:

- Front-end
- Back-end
- Databases
- Development Tools
- Build Systems
- Automation and Build Tools
- Accessibility
- Web Performance
- Monitoring Tools
- UX/UI
- Design
- Deploy and CI/CD
- Testing
- Soft Skills and Communication
- Project Management
- Networking
- Security
- DevOps
- Serverless
- Microservices
- Cloud
- Functional Programming
- Debugging Techniques
- Development Practices
- Community
- AI

This is a long-term project. I want to invite some friends from the web community to join in. It’s starting now, and I’d love to see you here!

Join me in getting stronger! Stick around for more updates and share this with a friend.
